<h3>Exercise I</h3>

a) O(n) time. It will take 'n' times to complete because the while loop is one 'n' larger ( n^3 vs n^2)

b) O(log_n) time because you're halfing 'n' each time.

c) O(sqrt(n)) 

d) O(n log n) - classic nested loops

e) O(log n^3) - n is in 3 of the loops thus n^3

f) linear

g) linear
